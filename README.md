This book is deployed using the docs folder that was set up in the _quarto.yml.

The idea is for each of us to work on a topic that complements the lessons, especially on practical exercises that can also be used during the lectures.
You have to clone the repository, create a file name_of_the_topic.qmd and let me know to add it as a chapter. 

It may seem like a lot of work, but for future lectures this will make things easier.

Best, Ignacio

btw, the content is not precise because it still has part of the template.
